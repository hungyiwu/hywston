# On usefulness of concepts

Was reading Anne Carpenter's article [Bridging Domain and Data](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2666-3899%2820%2930084-2) this morning. Just a few paragraphs into it and I've fallen into thoughts deeply.

Scenario 1
> A (looking at data): so where are the T cells here?  
  B: what do you mean by T cells?  
  A: it's CD3+  
  B (brings up an image): is this a T cell?  
  A: maybe, I guess  

If that's familiar to you, then look at this one:

Scenario 2
> B: how do you know this is the correct contrast setting for this CD3 image?  
  A: I know it when I see it  

Seems familiar to you? Then finally look at this:

A common meme on programmer tweets
> C: your code didn't work on my computer  
  D: but it works on mine  
  C: then we'll ship your computer  

If you didn't see the relevance, try replacing `your code` by `how you adjust the contrast` and also replacing `computer` with `head`.

As all programming people may have learned already, the first step to automate a task is to write down, in specific language, what the task does. If it cannot be described in plain logic, it's not possible to automate it. If this still doesn't resonate with you, search "Exact Instruction Challenge video" on either Google, YouTube or DuckDuckGo.

But what about machine learning models that figure out how to do it for us? Well, if you delegate this job to machine learning, it's not gone but simply out-sourced to people who sit down and manually annotate the data.

As Anne said in her article, biology is messy in how it approaches problems. In case you haven't realized already, biology has been there for decades, if not centuries, and has been useful for an equal amount of time. It's relied upon by people, not because of how it approaches problems, but because it's useful. That's where the source of value chain sits here: it saves lives, improves life quality, and so on. That's like how projects get funded: they are either useful soon or immediately ("applied science"), or they promise usefulness some time in the future ("basic science"). Remember how nuclear magnetic resonance research was justified? "It's so basic then but proved to be so valuable now, so let's fund more basic research (because they might prove usefulness in the future)." ps. In case it's not clear enough, I have no opposition to funding basic research, because I'm also a big fan of usefulness, either immediately, soon, or some time in the future.

That reminds me of traditional Chinese medicine, sometimes called Han medicine. My fiance was a double-major in modern medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in medical school and she once brought me to a study group session of traditional Chinese medicine. I studied chemistry in college and got a master's degree in biophysical chemistry at that time, and I was blown away by how people in that study group perceive human body. Asked a few of them, including my fiance, if they also feel the contradiction between this and modern medicine, and the common theme in their responses is "well it has been relied upon for centuries, so it must have gotten something right in the theory."

Sounds familiar? Here are two more examples in different domains:

In physical chemistry, Arrhenius equation
> E: It's an over-simplified model, doesn't fit to data very well. Why do you still teach it?  
  F: Well it's useful in bringing the concept of activation energy into the framework  

In machine learning, deep neural network
> G: This model is far from intuitive and your explanation of how it works doesn't really explain much  
  H: Well it's got a decent accuracy and is used in production, so I guess it must have learned something
  
If there's anything I can write down to wrap up this post and get to work because it's Monday morning, and also do my breakfast dishes, it's probably this:

> For me, understanding where the source of value chain and know that I can appreciate the usefulness without the need to also accept the description/model/explanation is a major lesson in grad school.  

Or, in a less polite way, the fact that they are fine people doing useful research doesn't contradict with me thinking what they just said is bull$h!t.

> The concept of "there's a type of cell called T cell" is frequently referenced in the same way that we still teach Arrhenius equation in physical chemistry. They are used by people in the hope to bring usefulness. They may or may not make sense, but people's hope that these concepts may bring value down the road definitely makes sense.
