# Data, model, and value

Some emerging thoughts from my daily commute. No, not for you; I'm writing to the future me. Cuz you know, didn't expect reading my (few) blog posts in this repo can refresh some configurations in my brain. This one might also prove useful in the future.

## 1. Data can never be wrong; only models can

I might got this belief from learning Bayesian statistics, but now whenever I reminded myself of this belief the term "Bayesian" may or may not come along.

Your model got a noise term? Yeah you are specifying how this model can go wrong, in a open and transparent way. Because reality never goes "wrong". "What if the users behave differently this time because they happened to have a bad day?" Ah seems like your model didn't address their bad day then. "But that cannot be modeled, so we'd call it noise." Sure if you like to call it that way, but would you go to the users and tell them "hey your bad day is a noise"?

## 2. Data does not have much value; models have value

The value of data comes from the hope (or promise) that it can help form a good model, which then can deliver values. Data itself does not offer much value other than that as I see it.

## 3. The less wrong a model is, the more value it offers

A model that's only half correct does not equal to a coin flip as long as we know which half it's correct on.

## 4. `import life_experience as data, strategy as model`

If applying all the above to life, it'd be like this:
1. define strategy as how you perceive your life experience, how you interpret the current situation, and how you predict the world model [1] will evolve/respond to your plan(s)
2. your life experience is never wrong
3. but your life experience itself doesn't offer value, to you or to others
4. what's valuable is your mind machine, how you ingest information and the quality of your prediction of the future
5. your prediction or decisions made is not worthless for not being the optimal ones; they are evaluated by how less wrong they are
